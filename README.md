Django Axes: Safeguarding Your Application Against Brute Force Attacks

Django Axes is a powerful Django app that helps protect your web application from brute force attacks. It provides you with tools to monitor and control login attempts to your site, ensuring the security of your users' accounts.

## Installation

Before you get started, make sure you have a Django project up and running. You can install Django Axes using `pip`:

```bash
pip install django-axes
For more detailed configuration options, please refer to the Django Axes documentation.

Usage
Django Axes automatically tracks login attempts, and when a user exceeds the allowed number of failed login attempts within a specified time period, it can lock them out or take other defined actions.

Monitoring Lockouts
You can check the lockout status of users in the Django admin panel under the "Axes" section. This allows you to see which users have been locked out and view their details.

Customizing Lockout Actions
You can define custom actions to be taken when a user is locked out. For example, you can send email notifications, block IP addresses, or take any other appropriate actions to secure your application.
